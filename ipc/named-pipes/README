ABOUT
	The idea is to demonstrate the use of named pipes also called FIFOs

FILES
	fifo-writer.c	Opens and writes into a fifo
	fifo-reader.c	Opens and reads from the fifo
	common.h 	The fifo is named here

RUNNING
	mkfifo <PATHANAME> to create the fifo eg ./mkfifo  /tmp/myfifo
	./rd <PATHANAME>
	./wr <PATHANAME>

	Just for fun see change in behaviour by subsituting the fifo with a normal file
