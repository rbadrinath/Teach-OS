ABOUT
	The idea is to demonstrate the use of named pipes also called FIFOs

FILES
	fifo-writer.c	Opens and writes into a fifo
	fifo-reader.c	Opens and reads from the fifo
	fifo-re-rw.c    Opens for both reading and writing, done sequentially
	common.h 	The fifo is named here

RUNNING
   Expt-1:
	mkfifo <PATHANAME> to create the fifo eg ./mkfifo  /tmp/myfifo
	./rd <PATHANAME>
	./wr <PATHANAME>
   Expt-2:
	Independently try out:
	./both

Some experiments:
	1. Change the writer's sleep value (or remove it)
	2. Just for fun see change in behaviour by subsituting 
		the fifo with a normal file
