FILES
	common.h	: Defines the server port number

  Use these in groups:

  0. A simple client and server using a utility called netcat (or nc)
     simple_tcp_server.sh : This is the server, will listen for connections
     simple_tcp_client.sh : This is the client, will make connections

  1. TCP Single send receive pair
	tcp_client.c	: A simple TCP client. Sends only one message.
	tcp_server.c	: A simple TCP server. Receives one message only 
						from a client.

  2. TCP Send receive until client closes   - a pair
	conc_server.c	: A concurrent server. Will send/rcv messages as long
			   as the client does not close the connection.
	tcp_long_client.c : A TCP client that send multiple messages.
			   This is intended to be used with conc_server.c

  3. UDP
	udp_server.c	: A simple UDP server
	udp_echo_server.c : A UDP server that repeatedly 
			receives from any clients
	udp_client.c	: A simple UDP client
			  Can pair this client with one of the above servers
        NOTE: One could also use nc -u 127.0.0.1 9999 as a client
			

  4. UNIX 
	unx_server.c	: A simple UNIX SOCK server.
	unx_client.c	: A simple UNIX SOCK client.
