This contains a simple example to show how shared memory can be used
between different processes.

The example here uses POSIX shared memory interface.

shm_ctl.c   :  Has individual operations open, close, unlink,
		It uses ftruncate   and   mmap to create the shared region	
		in the address space.
		You can run two instances of this and see how they
		share space. Use mmap to investigate the mapping

filler.c    : Fills shared memory with some data

reader.c    : Reads and prints what is filled in the shared memory

Usage:
	./shm_ctl -h
	./fl		: to run the filler process (good to unlink at start)
			 Note: The filler code zeros the shared area before
			  it fills. So od -x /dev/shm/ex1 shows you the data
					in hex
	./rd		: to run the reader process
