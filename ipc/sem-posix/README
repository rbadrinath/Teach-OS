	pc.c    :	Has a number of threads as producers and consumers
			for a shared queue structure 
			You can set NUMPRODUCERS/NUMCONSUMERS
			Also you can set size of the shared queue
		Note:	There is a #define NAMED_SEM for chosing which type
			of semaphore
			If named semaphore is uses the semaphore is 
			first removed before it initializes
	./pc


	sem_ctl.c :	This uses named semaphores.
			And illustrates basic operations.
