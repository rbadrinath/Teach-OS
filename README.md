# Teach-OS

The content here was created for an introductory course on operating systems
I taught for the undergraduate students at IIIT Bangalore in the
semester January to May 2022.

There is an attempt to use makefiles, some times in different formats to
encourage students to think about how makefiles work.


Not all the code is perfect, but most of it works quite well. Also the intention
is that students will pick up the code, modify and experiment with it.

A lot can be improved and it is perhaps best left to students to figure out 
issues and fix them :-)
