Investiage page virtual address and physical addresses
------------------------------------------------------

Use pmap `pidof command`    to view the  virtual address space of a running process
You'll need to do a sudo if the command is not owned by the user

frameit.c              : Adapted from the internet (see file for credits)
			 It takes and pid and a virtual address and tells us about the corresponding frame
			 Used with sudo: like     sudo ./frameit   pid  400000    (address is assumed bas 16)
										  (pid could also be self)
