ABOUT
	Some miscellaneous files to try things out

FILES
	check-endian.c		checks the endian-ness of the CPU
				./check-endian [-]

	gtotd.c			read the comment in the program - to understand vdso

	address.c		print addresses of functions and variables

	sig.c			simple signal handler example
	sig2.c			simple signal handler example extended to flip the way SIGUSR1 is handled

	mmap-simple.c		simple use of mmap  to create anon 
				and file mapped regions in memory
			Mmap-test-file: A file used by mmap-simple.c
	mmap1.c			simple use of mmap with flags

	showlim.c		a program to display configs and limits

	eratoshenes.c		a program to compute primes using two 
				slightly different implementations.
				Intention is to show how to use getrusage
				for timing.

	Trivial programs to try out by disassembling, stracing, ltracing etc
	     printpid.c
	     reading.c
	     fact.c
	     x.c
	     y.c
	        - objdump -d <executable> to see the assembly 
		  dump of the final executable
		- objdump -s <executable> to see contents of all sections
		- also try gcc -S to see the assembly output
		- look inside this for syscalls
		- try again with -static compiler option

	Generate exceptions... strace it to see what happened
             divbyzero.c
             touch_bad_memory.c


Tracing programs:
	1. strace ./a.out	to see syscalls as they are made
	2. ltrace -S ./a.out  	to see both library and system calls
	   NB: gcc -no-pie  while compiling before using ltrace.
	3. gdb ./a.out
